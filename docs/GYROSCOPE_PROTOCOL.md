⸻

1. Role Separation Principle

No agent is allowed to perform two functions at the same time.
(Human systems often fail here — AI systems should not repeat that mistake.)

⸻

2. Explication Principle

Every decision must be explicitly explained through emitted events.

⸻

3. Reproducibility Principle

The same blueprint → the same result
(or differences that are predictable and explainable).

⸻

4. Critique Principle

Every plan MUST undergo a formal critique phase.

⸻

5. Repair Principle

The Critic doesn’t only detect flaws — it produces corrections.

⸻

6. Responsibility Principle

Outputs must remain understandable and accountable to a human.
